# About Us

We are a small team of passionate Rust engineers. Seeing the potential of Rust to become one of the most important languages of our era, we sought to improve the data engineering toolings to make it a reality.

Rust is not just a programming language. It's a set of open-source values, an approach to software engineering, an ecosystem for libraries, but most importantly, a community for programmers like us to collaborate and thrive.

If you decided to develop software in Rust, that piece of software must be important to you, and other people. So much so you are willing to design it delicately and maintain it long term.

If you decided to contribute to Rust, then you truely believe in that sharing knowledge and experience will benefit others in the community and in turn ourselves.

Welcome to the community! You are also one of us.
