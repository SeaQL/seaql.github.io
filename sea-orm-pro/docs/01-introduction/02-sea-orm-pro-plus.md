# SeaORM Pro Plus

SeaORM Pro is free-to-use software. All backend source code is MIT Licensed, but the frontend source code is closed for the time being.

[SeaORM Pro Plus](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm-pro-plus) provides additional features and access to the frontend source code.

You can access the repository as a [Pro tier Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/SeaQL/sponsorships?tier_id=249708). The license grant is perpetual (you can use the software forever) and you will receive updates while being a sponsor.

As of the initial release, there is no additional features unlocked. We would prioritize answering questions and feature requests from sponsors.

This should not be viewed as an attempt to monetize, but a means for us to crowd source ideas (and some funding) for the development of new features. So being a sponsor you'd play a role in shaping the product's future!

Eventually, after reaching a certain level of maturity, we'd like to release a community version of SeaORM Pro under an open-source license so that it will be completely free (as in freedom). This is our end goal.
