# SeaORM Pro Plus

SeaORM Pro is free-to-use software. All backend source code is MIT Licensed, but the frontend source code is close-sourced for the time being.

[SeaORM Pro Plus](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm-pro-plus) provides additional features and access to the frontend source code.

You can access the repository as a [Pro tier Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/SeaQL/sponsorships?tier_id=249708). The license grant is perpetual (you can use the software forever) and you will receive updates while being a sponsor.

SeaORM Pro Plus unlocks RBAC, notifications, and other business‑centric features. We prioritize answering questions and feature requests from sponsors.

This serves as a way for us to crowdsource ideas for new features. As a sponsor, you'll play a role in shaping the product's future.

Eventually, after reaching a certain level of maturity, we'd like to release a community version of SeaORM Pro under an open-source license so that it will be completely free (as in freedom). This is our end goal.
