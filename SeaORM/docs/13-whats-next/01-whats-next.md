# What's Next for SeaORM?

We still remember the time when we first [introduced SeaORM](https://www.sea-ql.org/blog/2021-09-20-introducing-sea-orm/) to the Rust community 4 years ago.

Today, many open-source projects, many startups and companies are using SeaORM. If your company is using SeaORM and would like to be featured, please consider [becoming a company sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/SeaQL?frequency=one-time), and/or [consult with SeaQL.org](mailto:hello@sea-ql.org). Our team can help you adopt and unlock the full potential of the Rust + SeaQL ecosystem by providing expert consulting to support your software development.

Open-source project is a never-ending work, and we are actively looking for ways to sustain the project. SeaQL.org is an independent open-source organization run by passionate developers. You can support us by starring and sharing our repositories and making a donation via [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/SeaQL).
