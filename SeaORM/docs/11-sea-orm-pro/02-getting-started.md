## [Getting Started](https://www.sea-ql.org/sea-orm-pro/docs/install-and-config/getting-started/)

SeaORM Pro is a full-stack web framework based on Loco with all the scaffolding so you don't have to start from scratch.

You can launch your own admin portal in minutes starting from nothing but a database with some data!

It involves:

1. Environment Setup
2. Generate Entities
3. Launch!

## [Getting Started with Axum](https://www.sea-ql.org/sea-orm-pro/docs/install-and-config/getting-started-axum/)

We use the axum_example example as the base, it contains basic REST API to handle basic user management such as user login and user info of current session.

1. Setup Admin Endpoint
2. Setup GraphQL Endpoint
3. Launch!
