SeaORM Pro is an admin panel solution allowing you to quickly and easily launch an admin panel for your application - frontend development skills not required (but certainly nice to have).

An admin panel is essential for operating backend applications. But it often is an after-thought, or no dedicated resources (aka developer time) is put into developing them.

Frontend engineers are usually focused on developing consumer-facing applications, which often led to insufficient effort being directed towards GUI of internal-facing applications.

SeaORM Pro is designed to bridge this gap, providing a solution that is both quick to implement and reliable for long-term use.
