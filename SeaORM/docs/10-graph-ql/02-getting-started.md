# Getting Started

This example can be found on [Seaography Example](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/tree/master/examples/seaography_example).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/master/examples/seaography_example/Seaography%20example.png)

To get started, all you need is a live SQL database with schema. You can code everything in Rust by writing SeaORM migrations, or design the schema with a GUI tool (e.g. [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/)).

## Install Seaography CLI

```sh
cargo install seaography-cli@^2.0.0-rc
```

## Generate Seaography Entities

```sh
sea-orm-cli generate entity --output-dir graphql/src/entities --entity-format dense --seaography
```

Generate entities with `sea-orm-cli` like you normally do, but with an additional `--seaography` flag. The entities are basically good-old SeaORM entities, but with an additional `RelatedEntity` enum.

```rust {24-30} title="examples/seaography_example/graphql/src/entities/cake.rs"
//! `SeaORM` Entity, @generated by sea-orm-codegen 2.0.0-rc.11

use sea_orm::entity::prelude::*;

#[sea_orm::model]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, DeriveEntityModel, Eq)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "cake")]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    pub name: String,
    #[sea_orm(column_type = "Decimal(Some((16, 4)))")]
    pub price: Decimal,
    pub bakery_id: i32,
    pub gluten_free: bool,
    #[sea_orm(belongs_to, from = "bakery_id", to = "id")]
    pub bakery: HasOne<super::bakery::Entity>,
    #[sea_orm(has_many, via = "cake_baker")]
    pub bakers: HasMany<super::baker::Entity>,
}

impl ActiveModelBehavior for ActiveModel {}

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, EnumIter, DeriveRelatedEntity)]
pub enum RelatedEntity {
    #[sea_orm(entity = "super::bakery::Entity")]
    Bakery,
    #[sea_orm(entity = "super::baker::Entity")]
    Baker,
}
```

## Generate GraphQL Project

Generating a fresh project is the easiest way to launch a GraphQL server.
However, Seaography can easily be integrated to an existing web server built with any web framework.

Seaography supports Poem, Actix, and Axum out of the box.

Run the following command:

```sh
seaography-cli --framework axum graphql graphql/src/entities $DATABASE_URL sea-orm-seaography-example
```

Full help:

```sh
ðŸ§­ A dynamic GraphQL framework for SeaORM

Usage: seaography-cli [OPTIONS] <DESTINATION> <ENTITIES> <DATABASE_URL> <CRATE_NAME>

Arguments:
  <DESTINATION>   Project destination folder
  <ENTITIES>      SeaORM entities folder
  <DATABASE_URL>  Database URL to write in .env
  <CRATE_NAME>    Crate name for generated project

Options:
  -f, --framework <FRAMEWORK>
          Which web framework to use [default: poem] [possible values: actix, poem, axum]
      --depth-limit <DEPTH_LIMIT>
          GraphQL depth limit
      --complexity-limit <COMPLEXITY_LIMIT>
          GraphQL complexity limit
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version
```

## Start the server

```sh
cd graphql
cargo run
```

You are of course free to modify the project to suit your needs.
The interesting bit starts at the `seaography::register_entities!` macro in `query_root.rs`.
You can add custom entities, queries and mutations to the GraphQL schema.

## Run some queries

```sh
Visit GraphQL Playground at http://localhost:8000
```

Navigate to the GraphQL Playground, and then start running some queries!

## Run some queries

### Find chocolate cakes and know where to buy them

```graphql
{
  cake(filters: { name: { contains: "Chocolate" } }) {
    nodes {
      name
      price
      bakery {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Find all cakes baked by Alice

```graphql
{
  cake(having: { baker: { name: { eq: "Alice" } } }) {
    nodes {
      name
      price
      baker {
        nodes {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Bakery -> Cake -> Baker

```graphql
{
  bakery(pagination: { page: { limit: 10, page: 0 } }, orderBy: { name: ASC }) {
    nodes {
      name
      cake {
        nodes {
          name
          price
          baker {
            nodes {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
