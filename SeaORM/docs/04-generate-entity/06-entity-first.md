# Entity First Workfllow

## What's Entity first?

SeaORM used to adopt a schema‑first approach: meaning you design database tables and write migration scripts first, then generate entities from that schema.

Entity‑first flips the flow: you hand-write the entity files, and let SeaORM generates the tables and foreign keys for you.

All you have to do is to add the following to your [`main.rs`](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/blob/master/examples/quickstart/src/main.rs) right after creating the database connection:

```rust
let db = &Database::connect(db_url).await?;
// synchronizes database schema with entity definitions
db.get_schema_registry("my_crate::entity::*").sync(db).await?;
```

This requires two feature flags `schema-sync` and `entity-registry`, and we're going to explain what they do.

## Entity Registry

The above function `get_schema_registry` unfolds into the following:

```rust
db.get_schema_builder()
    .register(comment::Entity)
    .register(post::Entity)
    .register(profile::Entity)
    .register(user::Entity)
    .sync(db)
    .await?;
```

You might be wondering: how can SeaORM recognize my entities when, at compile time, the SeaORM crate itself has no knowledge of them?

Rest assured, there's no source‑file scanning or other hacks involved - this is powered by the brilliant [`inventory`](https://docs.rs/inventory/latest/inventory/) crate. The `inventory` crate works by registering items (called plugins) into linker-collected sections.

At compile-time, each `Entity` module registers itself to the global `inventory` along with their module paths and some metadata. On runtime, SeaORM then filters the Entities you requested and construct a [`SchemaBuilder`](https://docs.rs/sea-orm/2.0.0-rc.15/sea_orm/schema/struct.SchemaBuilder.html).

The `EntityRegistry` is completely optional and just adds extra convenience, it's perfectly fine for you to `register` Entities manually like above.

## Resolving Entity Relations

If you remember from the previous post, you'll notice that `comment` has a foreign key referencing `post`. Since SQLite doesn't allow adding foreign keys after the fact, the `post` table must be created before the `comment` table.

This is where SeaORM shines: it automatically builds a dependency graph from your entities and determines the correct topological order to create the tables, so you don't have to keep track of them in your head.

## Schema Sync in Action

The second feature, `schema-sync`, compares the in‑memory entity definitions with the live database schema, detects missing tables, columns, and keys, and creates them idempotently - no matter how many times you run `sync`, the schema converges to the same state.

Let's walk through the different scenarios:

### Adding Table

Let's say you added a new Entity under `mod.rs`

```rust title="entity/mod.rs"
//! `SeaORM` Entity, @generated by sea-orm-codegen 2.0.0-rc.14

pub mod prelude;

pub mod post;
pub mod upvote; // ⬅ new entity module
..
```

The next time you `cargo run`, you'll see the following:

```sh
CREATE TABLE "upvote" ( "id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, .. )
```

This will create the table along with any foreign keys.

### Adding Columns

```rust title="entity/profile.rs"
use sea_orm::entity::prelude::*;

#[sea_orm::model]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, DeriveEntityModel)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "profile")]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    pub picture: String,
    pub date_of_birth: Option<DateTimeUtc>, // ⬅ new column
    ..
}

impl ActiveModelBehavior for ActiveModel {}
```

The next time you `cargo run`, you'll see the following:

```sh
ALTER TABLE "profile" ADD COLUMN "date_of_birth" timestamp with time zone
```

How about adding a non-nullable column? You can set a `default_value` or `default_expr`:

```rust
#[sea_orm(default_value = 0)]
pub post_count: i32,

// this doesn't work in SQLite
#[sea_orm(default_expr = "Expr::current_timestamp()")]
pub updated_at: DateTimeUtc,
```

### Rename Column

If you only want to rename the field name in code, you can simply remap the column name:

```rust
pub struct Model {
    ..
    #[sea_orm(column_name = "date_of_birth")]
    pub dob: Option<DateTimeUtc>, // ⬅ renamed for brevity
}
```

This doesn't involve any schema change.

If you want to actually rename the column, then you have to add a special attribute. Note that you can't simply change the field name, as this will be recognized as adding a new column.

```rust
pub struct Model {
    ..
    #[sea_orm(renamed_from = "date_of_birth")] // ⬅ special annotation
    pub dob: Option<DateTimeUtc>,
}
```

The next time you `cargo run`, you'll see the following:

```sh
ALTER TABLE "profile" RENAME COLUMN "date_of_birth" TO "dob"
```

Nice, isn't it?

### Add Foreign Key

Let's create a new table with a foreign key:

```rust title="entity/upvote.rs"
use sea_orm::entity::prelude::*;

#[sea_orm::model]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, DeriveEntityModel)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "upvote")]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key, auto_increment = false)]
    pub post_id: i32,
    #[sea_orm(belongs_to, from = "post_id", to = "id")]
    pub post: HasOne<super::post::Entity>,
    ..
}

impl ActiveModelBehavior for ActiveModel {}
```

The next time you `cargo run`, you'll see the following:

```sh
CREATE TABLE "upvote" (
    "post_id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    ..
    FOREIGN KEY ("post_id") REFERENCES "post" ("id")
)
```

If however, the `post` relation is added after the table has been created, then the foreign key couldn't be created for SQLite. Relational queries would still work, but functions completely client-side.

### Add Unique Key

Now, let's say we've forgotten to add a unique constraint on user name:

```rust title="entity/user.rs"
use sea_orm::entity::prelude::*;

#[sea_orm::model]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, DeriveEntityModel)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "user")]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    #[sea_orm(unique)] // ⬅ add unique key
    pub name: String,
    #[sea_orm(unique)]
    pub email: String,
    ..
}
```

The next time you `cargo run`, you'll see the following:

```sh
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "idx-user-name" ON "user" ("name")
```

As mentioned in the previous blog post, you'll also get a shorthand method generated on the Entity:

```rust
user::Entity::find_by_name("Bob")..
```

### Remove Unique Key

Well, you've changed your mind and want to remove the unique constraint on user name:

```rust
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    // no annotation
    pub name: String,
    #[sea_orm(unique)]
    pub email: String,
    ..
}
```

The next time you `cargo run`, you'll see the following:

```sh
DROP INDEX "idx-user-name"
```

## Footnotes

Note that in general schema sync would not attempt to do any destructive actions, so meaning no `DROP` on tables, columns and foreign keys. Dropping index is an exception here.

Every time the application starts, a full schema discovery is performed. This may not be desirable in production, so `sync` is gated behind a feature flag `schema-sync` that can be turned off based on build profile.
