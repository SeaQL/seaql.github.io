# Delete

## Delete One

Find a `Model` from the database, then delete the corresponding row from database.

```rust
let orange: Option<fruit::Model> = Fruit::find_by_id(30).one(db).await?;
let orange: fruit::Model = orange.unwrap();

let res: DeleteResult = orange.delete(db).await?;
assert_eq!(res.rows_affected, 1);
```

## Delete Many

You can also delete multiple rows from the database without finding each `Model` with SeaORM select.

```rust
// DELETE FROM `fruit` WHERE `fruit`.`name` LIKE '%Orange%'
let res: DeleteResult = fruit::Entity::delete_many()
    .filter(fruit::Column::Name.contains("Orange"))
    .exec(db)
    .await?;

assert_eq!(res.rows_affected, 2);
```
