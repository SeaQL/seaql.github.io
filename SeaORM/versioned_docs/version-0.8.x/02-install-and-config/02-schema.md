# Schema Management

If you already have a database with tables and data, you can skip this section and move on to [generating SeaORM entities](03-generate-entity/01-sea-orm-cli.md).

If you are starting from a fresh database, it's actually better to version control your database schema with a migration tool. Follow the steps in [migration docs](/SeaORM/docs/migration/setting-up-migration) to write the migration and run it to create tables in the database. Then, read on [generating SeaORM entities](03-generate-entity/01-sea-orm-cli.md).
