# Looking Forward

Seaography is a venture into unknown territory, as this mode of operation and abstraction is something not attempted before. We are excited of the possibilities it brings to the SeaORM ecosystem.

However, Seaography is still in an early stage, and we need your idea, feedback and contribution!
