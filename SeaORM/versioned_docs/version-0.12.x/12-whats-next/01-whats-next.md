# What's Next for SeaORM?

We still remember the time when we first [introduced SeaORM](https://www.sea-ql.org/blog/2021-09-20-introducing-sea-orm/) to the Rust community two years ago.

Today, many open-source projects, a handful of startups and many more closed-source projects are using SeaORM. If your company is using SeaORM and would like to be featured, please [submit a testimonial](https://forms.office.com/r/YbeqfTAgkJ).

If you are using SeaORM, please participate in the [Community Survey](https://www.sea-ql.org/community-survey). Your response will influence the decisions we'd make regarding the project's future. In particular, is the current feature set good enough to be regarded 'stable'? Shall we name this release a `1.0`? Or shall we mark this release as `LTS` and support it for long? Will this drive adoption or hamper progress?

Open-source project is a never-ending work, and we are actively looking for ways to sustain the project. SeaQL.org is an independent open-source organization run by passionate developers. You can support us by starring and sharing our repositories and making a donation via [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/SeaQL).

We are considering multiple directions to generate revenue for the organization. Whatever we do, we want to remain as a non-profit organization. If you have any suggestion, or want to join or collaborate with us, please let us know via `hello[at]sea-ql.org`.

Thank you for your support so far, and together we can make open-source sustainable.
