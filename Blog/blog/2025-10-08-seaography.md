GraphQL has become a favorite among frontend developers - its flexibility, type-safety, and ability to fetch exactly the data you need make it a joy to work with. But on the backend, things aren't always so easy. Implementing a relational resolver that can traverse complex schemas is difficult and time-consuming.

Yes, there are libraries that can spin up a GraphQL resolver instantly, but they often come with trade-offs: they're hard to customize, making it painful to add additional endpoints when your application grows beyond the basics.

And perhaps the hardest challenge is access control and business logic. Real-world applications need fine-grained permissions and conditional query logic based on context - things that no technology currently on the market can easily solve.

Seaography + SeaORM is designed to solve this problem.

## What is Seaography

A video is worth a thousand words, so let's look at a quick demo.

  <source src="/blog/img/Seaography%20Demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.

In under a minute, we've done the following:
1. Generate SeaORM entities from an existing sakila database (SQLite in demo)
2. Generate a GraphQL web server around the entities
3. Launch it and run some queries with GraphQL playground

This is of course a speed run, but you can follow the same steps easily, and the generated framework is fully customizable.

### What kinds of queries are supported?

#### Filter, Ordering and Pagination

```graphql
{
  film(
    filters: {
      title: { contains: "sea" }
      # composable attribute filters
      and: [{ releaseYear: { gt: "2000" } }, { length: { gt: 120 } }]
    }
    orderBy: { filmId: ASC }
    # cursor based pagination is also supported
    pagination: { page: { page: 0, limit: 10 } }
  ) {
    nodes {
      filmId
      title
      description
    }
    paginationInfo {
      pages
      current
    }
  }
}
```

#### Nested Relational Query

The following query finds us all the documentaries starred by the actor "Bob" along with the stores having it in stock so that we can go rent it.

```graphql
{
  film(
    # filter by related entity
    having: {
      actor: { firstName: { eq: "Bob" } }
      category: { name: { eq: "Documentary" } }
    }
  ) {
    nodes {
      filmId
      title
      # skipped the film_actor junction
      actor {
        nodes {
          firstName
          lastName
        }
      }
      inventory {
        nodes {
          store {
            address {
              address
              city {
                city
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

There are two join paths in this query:

```rust
film -> film_actor -> actor
     -> inventory -> store -> address -> city
```

A data loader is used for resolving the relations, such that it does not suffers from N+1 problem.

#### Mutations: create, update, delete

Full CRUD is supported, including `CreateOne` `CreateBatch` `Update` and `Delete`.

```graphql
mutation {
  filmTextCreateBatch(
    data: [
      { filmId: 1, title: "Foo bar", description: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" }
      { filmId: 2, title: "Fizz buzz", description: "Consectetur adipiscing elit" }
    ]
    ) {
      filmId
      title
      description
    }
}
```

## Custom Endpoints

The above is not something entirely new, most features already exist in Seaography 1.0. The real game-changer is how you can implement custom endpoints and mix and match them with SeaORM entities. Let's dive into it!

### Custom Query with pagination

Seaography 2.0 introduced a set of macros to allow you to write custom query endpoints by reusing facilities in Seaography.

Let's say we have a Customer entity:

```rust
//! This is an entity from the sakila schema, generated by sea-orm-cli
use sea_orm::entity::prelude::*;

#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, DeriveEntityModel, Eq)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "customer")]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key, auto_increment = false)]
    pub customer_id: i32,
    pub store_id: i32,
    pub first_name: String,
    pub last_name: String,
    ..
}
```

We want to create a custom endpoint, like the one Seaography already provides, but with a additional requirement: only return customers of the current store from which the user makes request from.

```rust
use seaography::{apply_pagination, Connection, CustomFields, PaginationInput};

pub struct Operations;

#[CustomFields]
impl Operations {
    async fn customer_of_current_store(
        ctx: &Context<'_>,
        pagination: PaginationInput,
        //          ‚¨Ü this input struct is provided by Seaography
    ) -> async_graphql::Result<Connection<customer::Entity>> {
        //  this output struct ‚¨Ü is provided by Seaography
        let db = ctx.data::<DatabaseConnection>()?;
        //  ‚¨Ü this is a normal SeaORM db connection
        let session = ctx.data::<Session>()?;
        //  ‚¨Ü this session is inject by the HTTP handler
        let query = customer::Entity::find()
        //          ‚¨Ü this is the same old SeaORM API
            .filter(customer::Column::StoreId.eq(session.store_id));
        //  ‚¨Ü here we implement our custom logic
        // note that here, we haven't execute the query yet ..
        // instead, we pass it to Seaography to handle the rest!
        let connection = apply_pagination(&CONTEXT, db, query, pagination).await?;
        //                                         now the query executes ‚¨Ü 

        Ok(connection)
    }
}
```

This would expose the following query endpoint:

```graphql
customer_of_current_store(
  pagination: PaginationInput
): CustomerConnection!
```

Query it like to following:

```graphql
{
  customer_of_current_store(pagination: { page: { page: 0, limit: 10 } }) {
    nodes {
      storeId
      customerId
      firstName
      lastName
      email
    }
    paginationInfo {
      pages
      current
    }
  }
}
```

It's almost effortless, right? In just a few lines of code, we've added a new API endpoint that does a lot under the hood.
But the heavylifting is done by Seaography + SeaORM.

On a very high-level, how it all works:

1. Seaography bridges SeaORM types with Async GraphQL, such that any SeaORM entity can be used as GraphQL output
1. The schema meta of SeaORM entities are transformed into GraphQL schema on-the-fly on application startup

The lifecycle of a GraphQL request:

1. Async GraphQL parses the HTTP request and construct a GraphQL request context
1. Your http handler intercepts this request and adds in additional session context
1. This GraphQL request is passed to Seaography
1. Seaography parses the input types and then construct the Rust types
1. Your async resolver is called, performing some business logic and returns result to Seaography
1. Seaography transforms the output and return to Async GraphQL
1. Async GraphQL does some final checks and serializes everything into a HTTP response

You may wonder, isn't the above kind of already possible by using Async GraphQL's derive macros, for example, by deriving [`SimpleObject`](https://docs.rs/async-graphql/latest/async_graphql/derive.SimpleObject.html) on a SeaORM entity?

Actually this is how Seaography 0.1 works in the initial release. However, the complex queries we shown you in the beginning is only achievable with a dynamic schema, but in Async GraphQL the static and dynamic schemas are completely different type systems - they can't inter-operate. And there was no way to reuse generic components like above without generating tons of code underneath the surface... until now!
