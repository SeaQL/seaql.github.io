In our last post, we introduced a [Smart Entity Loader](https://www.sea-ql.org/blog/2025-10-20-sea-orm-2.0/) that made querying multi-path relations into nested models simple and efficient. That solved the read side of the problem.

With nested ActiveModel, you can now do the reverse: persist a nested object back into the database in one operation. SeaORM walks the tree, detects changes, constructs the insert and update statements, and executes them in the correct order to respect foreign key dependencies.

## Gist

The following operation saves a new set of user + profile + post + tag + post_tag into the database atomically:

```rust
let user = user::ActiveModel::builder()
    .set_name("Bob")
    .set_email("bob@sea-ql.org")
    .set_profile(profile::ActiveModel::builder().set_picture("image.jpg"))
    .add_post(
        post::ActiveModel::builder()
            .set_title("Nice weather")
            .add_tag(tag::ActiveModel::builder().set_tag("sunny")),
    )
    .save(db)
    .await?;
```

### Unfolding

This builder pattern constructs the following object tree:

```rust
user::ActiveModelEx {
    name: Set("Bob".into()),
    email: Set("bob@sea-ql.org".into()),
    profile: HasOneModel::Set(profile::ActiveModelEx {
        picture: Set("image.jpg".into()),
        ..Default::default()
    }),
    posts: HasManyModel::Append(post::ActiveModelEx {
        title: Set("Nice weather".into()),
        tags: HasManyModel::Append(tag::ActiveModel {
            tag: Set("sunny".into()),
            ..Default::default()
        }),
        ..Default::default()
    }),
    ..Default::default()
}
.save(db)
.await?
```

.. which is equivalent to doing the following manually:

```rust
let txn = db.begin().await?;

// insert a user
let user = user::ActiveModelEx {
    name: Set("Bob".into()),
    email: Set("bob@sea-ql.org".into()),
    ..Default::default()
}.insert(&txn).await?;

// profile belongs_to user (1-1)
let profile = profile::ActiveModelEx {
    user_id: Set(user.id),
    picture: Set("image.jpg".into()),
    ..Default::default()
}.insert(&txn).await?;

// post belongs_to user (1-N)
let post = post::ActiveModelEx {
    user_id: Set(user.id),
    title: Set("Nice weather".into()),
    ..Default::default()
}.insert(&txn).await?;

// insert a tag
let tag = tag::ActiveModel {
    tag: Set("sunny".into()),
    ..Default::default()
}
.insert(&txn)
.await?;

// associate tag to post
post_tag::ActiveModel {
    post_id: Set(post.id),
    tag_id: Set(tag.id),
}
.insert(&txn)
.await?;

txn.commit().await?;
```

## Relational Dependency

The core of the problem lies in figuring the foreign key relations between Entities and executing the queries in the correct order. SeaORM supports the following:

### Has One / Belongs To

User 1-1 Profile

```rust title="user.rs"
#[sea_orm::model]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, DeriveEntityModel)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "user")]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    #[sea_orm(has_one)]
    pub profile: HasOne<super::profile::Entity>,
    ..
}
```

There is a `unique` key on `user_id`, making this relation one-to-one.

```rust title="profile.rs"
#[sea_orm::model]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, DeriveEntityModel)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "profile")]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(unique)]
    pub user_id: i32,
    #[sea_orm(belongs_to, from = "user_id", to = "id")]
    pub user: HasOne<super::user::Entity>,
    ..
}
```

Since `profile` belongs to `user`, the user has to be inserted first to obtain it's `id`.

In SeaORM, it doesn't matter which way the model is nested, it will be executed in the correct order.

```rust
// also okay:
profile::ActiveModel::builder()
    .set_user(
        user::ActiveModel::builder()
            .set_name("Alice")
            .set_email("alice@rust-lang.org"),
    )
    .set_picture("image.jpg")
    .save(db)
    .await?;
```

### Has Many

User 1-N Post

```rust
#[sea_orm::model]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, DeriveEntityModel)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "post")]
pub struct Model {
    pub user_id: i32,
    #[sea_orm(belongs_to, from = "user_id", to = "id")]
    pub author: HasOne<super::user::Entity>,
    ..
}
```

This is very similar to 1-1, with the nested model being a vector instead of option.

There are two possible actions: `Replace` and `Append`. The default action is append, which is non-destructive.

Let's say Bob has written a new blog post, there is no reason having to query all posts bob has written; we can simply do the following:

```rust
// query user, but no posts
let bob = user::Entity::load().filter_by_email("bob@sea-ql.org").one(db).await?.unwrap();

let mut bob.into_active_model();
bob.posts.push(post::ActiveModel::builder().set_title("Another weekend"));
bob.save(db).await?; // INSERT INTO post ..
```

However, sometimes we do want an empty vector to mean 'delete all', or we want to specify the *exact* set of children. Then we can use `Replace`.

```rust
bob.posts.replace_all([]); // delete all
bob.posts.replace_all([post_1]); // retain only this post
```

This will result in the following actions, where posts other than post 1 will be deleted:

```sql
SELECT FROM post WHERE user_id = bob.id
DELETE FROM post WHERE id = 2
```

### Many to Many

Post M-N Tag

Many-to-many relations are essential when modeling complex schemas. A unique feature of SeaORM is that it models many-to-many relations as a first-class construct, so you don't need to think about the junction table.

```rust title="post.rs"
#[sea_orm::model]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, DeriveEntityModel)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "post")]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    pub title: String,
    #[sea_orm(has_many, via = "post_tag")] // ⬅ specify junction table
    pub tags: HasMany<super::tag::Entity>,
    ..
}
```

```rust title="post_tag.rs"
#[sea_orm::model]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, DeriveEntityModel, Eq)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "post_tag")]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key, auto_increment = false)] // ⬅ composite key
    pub post_id: i32,
    #[sea_orm(primary_key, auto_increment = false)] // ⬅ composite key
    pub tag_id: i32,
    #[sea_orm(belongs_to, from = "post_id", to = "id")] // ⬅ belongs to both
    pub post: Option<super::post::Entity>,
    #[sea_orm(belongs_to, from = "tag_id", to = "id")] // ⬅ belongs to both
    pub tag: Option<super::tag::Entity>,
}
```

```rust title="tag.rs"
#[sea_orm::model]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, DeriveEntityModel)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "tag")]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    #[sea_orm(unique)]
    pub tag: String,
}
```

M-N relations is not just 1-N + 1-1, it actually breaks away from the notion. Let's look at the following example, insert a new post with 2 tags:

```rust
// Insert one tag for later use
let sunny = tag::ActiveModel::builder().set_tag("sunny").save(db).await?;

// Insert a new post with 2 tags
let post = post::ActiveModel::builder()
    .set_title("A sunny day")
    .set_user(bob)
    .add_tag(sunny) // an existing tag
    .add_tag(tag::ActiveModel::builder().set_tag("outdoor")) // a new tag
    .save(db) // new tag will be created and associcated to the new post
    .await?;
```

Which results in the following actions:

```sql
INSERT INTO post (user_id, title) VALUES (bob.id, 'A sunny day') RETURNING id
INSERT INTO tag (tag) VALUES ('outdoor') RETURNING id
INSERT INTO post_tag (post_id, tag_id) VALUES (post.id, sunny.id) (post.id, outdoor.id)
```

Their relation is no longer "belongs to", they are just associated with each other.
Removing tags from post does not delete the tags, but only the associations in the junction table.

```rust
post.tags.replace_all([outdoor]); // let's say we remove the tag sunny
```

Results in:

```sql
DELETE FROM post_tag WHERE (post_id, tag_id) IN ((post.id, sunny.id))
```

One more example to make this easier to grasp: in a Film M-N Actor relation, deleting a film does not delete its actors, since they can still appear in other films.

#### Note

SeaORM also supports using a surrogate primary key on the junction table, though a composite primary key is recommended.

```rust title="film_actor.rs"
#[sea_orm::model]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, DeriveEntityModel)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "film_actor")]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)] // ⬅ normal primary key
    pub id: i32,
    #[sea_orm(unique_key = "film_actor")] // ⬅ unique key
    pub film_id: i32,
    #[sea_orm(unique_key = "film_actor")] // ⬅ unique key
    pub actor_id: i32,
    #[sea_orm(belongs_to, from = "film_id", to = "id")]
    pub film: HasOne<super::film::Entity>,
    #[sea_orm(belongs_to, from = "actor_id", to = "id")]
    pub actor: HasOne<super::actor::Entity>,
}
```

## Change Detection

Let's go back to the basics, in SeaORM every Model is backed by an ActiveModel:

```rust title="post.rs"
pub struct ModelEx {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    pub user_id: i32,
    pub title: String,
    pub author: HasOne<super::user::Entity>,
    pub tags: HasMany<super::tag::Entity>,
}

// generated by macro:
pub struct ActiveModelEx {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: ActiveValue<i32>,
    pub user_id: ActiveValue<i32>,
    pub title: ActiveValue<String>,
    pub author: HasOneModel<super::user::Entity>,
    pub tags: HasManyModel<super::tag::Entity>,
}
```

Each `ActiveValue` is a tri-state.

```rust
pub enum ActiveValue<V>
{
    Set(V),
    Unchanged(V),
    NotSet,
}
```

This allows SeaORM to keep track of what's changed. When you first query a fresh Model from database, the default state is `Unchanged`. When you perform some change in code, the state will be changed to `Set`. So when you run `save`, *only the changed columns* are updated.

```rust
let post = post::Entity::find_by_id(22).one(db).await?.unwrap(); // Model
let mut post = post.into_active_model(); // ActiveModel
post.title = Set("The weather changed!");
post.save(db).await?; // UPDATE post SET title = '..' WHERE id = 22
```

This has two advantages: it avoids over-updating, reducing the amount of data sent over the wire. More importantly, multiple API endpoints can safely update different column sets without risk of race conditions and without relying on transactions or locking mechanisms.

This concept is extended to nested ActiveModels, allowing SeaORM to walk the nested object tree and determine which sub-tree has been changed and requires updating.

For example:

```rust
let mut bob: user::ActiveModel = ..;

// update post title
bob.posts[0].title = Set("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet".into());
// update post comment
bob.posts[0].comments[0].comment = Set("nice post! I learnt a lot".into());
// add a new comment too
bob.posts[1].comments.push(
    comment::ActiveModel::builder().set_comment("interesting!")
);
bob.save(db).await?;
```

Results in:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION

UPDATE post SET title = '..' WHERE id = post.id
UPDATE comment SET comment = '..' WHERE id = comment.id
INSERT INTO comment (post_id, comment) VALUES (post.id. '..')

COMMIT
```

It's a lot to take in, but once you build a clear mental model of SeaORM's concepts and mechanisms, you'll find yourself far more productive!

You can find all the techniques described in this blog post in a [single-file example application](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/blob/master/examples/quickstart/src/main.rs).

## Cascade Delete

If the relations are defined with `ON DELETE CASCADE`, this problem does not exist. However, SeaORM can also perform cascade deletes on the client side. It applies the same rules described above, but in reverse.

For example, Post belongs to User. All posts must be deleted before the user; otherwise, the SQL operation will fail.

```rust
let user_4 = user::Entity::find_by_id(4).one(db).await?.unwrap();

user_4.cascade_delete(db).await?; // equivalent to below
user_4.into_ex().delete(db).await?;
```

```sql
-- query the profile belonging to user
SELECT FROM profile INNER JOIN user ON user.id = profile.user_id WHERE user.id = 4 LIMIT 1
-- delete the profile, if exist
DELETE FROM profile WHERE profile.id = 2
-- query the posts belonging to user
SELECT FROM post INNER JOIN user ON user.id = post.user_id WHERE user.id = 4
-- query the comments belonging to post
SELECT FROM comment INNER JOIN post ON post.id = comment.post_id WHERE post.id = 7
-- delete the comments, if exist
DELETE FROM comment WHERE comment.id = 5
-- query the post's tags
SELECT FROM post_tag INNER JOIN post ON post_tag.post_id = post.id WHERE post.id = 7
-- delete the post-tag associations
DELETE FROM post_tag WHERE (post_id, tag_id) IN ((7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4))
-- post has no dependents, safe to delete now
DELETE FROM post WHERE post.id = 7
-- user has no dependents, safe to delete now
DELETE FROM user WHERE user.id = 4
```

### Weak Belongs To

There is one more special case of the Belongs To relation not yet mentioned: weak 1-N associations, where an entity may have an owner, but is not strictly required.

To give an example, Post 1-N Attachment. However users can upload attachments before drafting posts, thus some attachments may have no associated posts.

```rust title="attachment.rs"
#[sea_orm::model]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, DeriveEntityModel)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "attachment")]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    pub post_id: Option<i32>, // this is nullable
    pub file: String,
    #[sea_orm(belongs_to, from = "post_id", to = "id")]
    pub post: HasOne<super::post::Entity>,
}
```

```rust
// this post has attachment_2
let post_1 = post::Entity::find_by_id(1).one(db).await?.unwrap();
post_1.cascade_delete(db).await?;

// post_id of attachment will be set to null, instead of deleting the attachment
let attachment_2 = attachment::Entity::find_by_id(2).one(db).await?.unwrap();
assert!(attachment_2.post_id.is_none());
```

## Idempotence

The general rule of thumb is idempotence: saving an ActiveModel a second time should be a no-op.
Unless you use `replace` or `delete`, no delete will be executed.

```rust
let post = post.save(db).await?;
let post = post.save(db).await?; // no-op, as all fields are unchanged
```

The ActiveModel you provides is a snapshot of the desired final state of the data, and SeaORM should ensure that it ends up that way. This can be complicated, so please report any bugs.

### Tips

Keeping track of whether to use `insert` or `update` can be hard, unless the intended action is "create new from scratch". Use `save` as the default, and let SeaORM decide when to execute `insert` or `update`.

(If you already find these concepts familiar, it's no surprise that it's called ActiveModel.)

## Backwards Compatibility

All the 2.0 features introduced in this post are fully backwards compatible with 1.0, since only new types and methods have been added: `ActiveModelEx`, `HasOneModel`, `HasManyModel` and a few methods. `ActiveModel` continues to behave exactly as before.

However, due to the macros needing the relations' attributes to generate the implementations, these features are only available to `#[sea_orm::model]`, but not `#[sea_orm::compact_model]`.

## 🧭 Instant GraphQL API

With [Seaography](https://github.com/SeaQL/seaography), the Entities you wrote can *instantly* be exposed as a GraphQL schema, with full CRUD, filtering and pagination. No extra macros, no Entity re-generation is needed!

With SeaORM and Seaography, you can prototype quickly and stay in the flow. The Entity:

```rust
#[sea_orm::model]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, DeriveEntityModel)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "user")]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    pub name: String,
    #[sea_orm(unique)]
    pub email: String,
    #[sea_orm(has_one)]
    pub profile: HasOne<super::profile::Entity>,
    #[sea_orm(has_many)]
    pub posts: HasMany<super::post::Entity>,
}
```

Instantly turned into a GraphQL type:

```graphql
type User {
  id: Int!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  profile: Profile
  post(
    filters: PostFilterInput
    orderBy: PostOrderInput
    pagination: PaginationInput
  ): PostConnection!
}
```
