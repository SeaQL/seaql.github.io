SeaQuery 0.1.0 was first released on 2020-12-16 - it's been a few years! Since then, there have been 32 releases, each introducing a set of new features. As with many software projects, the organic evolution driven by a diverse community of open source contributors has led to occasional inconsistencies across the codebase. It's a good problem to have, and a testament to our vibrant community. But now, it's time to stabilize SeaQuery and address some of these issues.

A very brief recap of important SeaQuery verisons:

## Architectural changes

There are a few architectural changes that can only be made by breaking the API, so let's go through them one by one:

### Forbid unsafe code

[#930](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/930)
`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` has been added to all workspace crates, ensuring that SeaQuery no longer contains any unsafe code. While only one instance of unsafe was previously used, and has now been removed, this change reinforces our commitment to maintaining code quality.

### Unified `Expr` and `SimpleExpr` as one type

[#890](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/890) Previously, a lot of operator methods (e.g. `eq`) were duplicated across `Expr` and `SimpleExpr`, but the list of methods was slightly different for each. Also, it wasn't clear when to use each of the two types. The type conversions were sometimes non-obvious. It complicated the type system and made writing generic code difficult.

In 0.32.0, almost a year ago, we added `ExprTrait` ([#771](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/771)) to standardize and share the list of methods, and to allow calling them on other "lower-level" types like so: `1_i32.cast_as("REAL")`. At that time, we decided to keep the original inherent methods for compatibility, at the cost of ~1300 lines of code bloat.

Later, we looked into the `Expr` vs `SimpleExpr` distinction. It turned out that `Expr` was originally meant to be a "namespace" of static constructors for `SimpleExpr`, similar to [`Func`](https://docs.rs/sea-query/0.32.7/sea_query/func/struct.Func.html) vs [`FunctionCall`](https://docs.rs/sea-query/0.32.7/sea_query/func/struct.FunctionCall.html). Unlike `Func`, which is a unit struct, `Expr` has data fields, which led to `Expr`s being passed around, making it hard for functions to accept / return "expression fragments".

In 1.0, `SimpleExpr` is "merged into" `Expr`, meaning that `SimpleExpr` is now just a type alias of `Expr`. Both names can be used interchangeably. A lot of redundant type conversions (`.into()`) and generic code (`T: ExprTrait`) can now be removed.

The resulting "merged" type has all methods from the two original types, except for the methods defined by `ExprTrait`. Those inherent methods have been removed and have saved us 1300 lines of code.

```rust
enum Expr { // the AST node enum
    Column(ColumnRef),
    Tuple(Vec<Expr>),
    ..
}

type SimpleExpr = Expr; // now: just an alias

impl Expr {
    pub fn equals<C>(self, col: C) -> Self; // removed
}

trait ExprTrait: Sized {
    fn equals<C>(self, col: C) -> Expr; // please use this
}
```

#### Potential compile errors

If you implemented some trait for both of those types, two impls for one type will no longer compile and you'll need to delete one of the impls.

If you encounter the following error, please add `use sea_query::ExprTrait` in scope.

```rust
error[E0599]: no method named `like` found for enum `sea_query::Expr` in the current scope
    |
    |         Expr::col((self.entity_name(), *self)).like(s)
    |
    |     fn like<L>(self, like: L) -> Expr
    |        ---- the method is available for `sea_query::Expr` here
    |
    = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is in scope
help: trait `ExprTrait` which provides `like` is implemented but not in scope; perhaps you want to import it
    |
 -> + use sea_query::ExprTrait;
```
```rust
error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> src/sqlite/discovery.rs:27:57
   |
   |             .and_where(Expr::col(Alias::new("type")).eq("table"))
   |                                                      -- ^^^^^^^ expected `&Expr`, found `&str`
   |                                                      |
   |                                                      arguments to this method are incorrect
   |
   = note: expected reference `&sea_query::Expr`
              found reference `&'static str`
```

### Revamped `Iden` type system.

[#909](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/909)
Previously, `DynIden` is lazily rendered, i.e. the identifier is only constructed while serializing the AST. Now, it's an eagerly rendered string `Cow<'static, str>`, constructed while constructing the AST.

```rust
pub type DynIden = SeaRc<dyn Iden>;               // old
pub struct DynIden(pub(crate) Cow<'static, str>); // new

pub struct SeaRc<I>(pub(crate) RcOrArc<I>);       // old
pub struct SeaRc;                                 // new
```

The implications of this new design are:

1. Type info is erased from `Iden` early
2. `SeaRc` is no longer an alias to `Rc` / `Arc`. As such, `Send` / `Sync` is removed from the trait `Iden`

```rust
  - SeaRc::clone(&from_tbl)      // old
  + from_tbl.clone()             // new
```

#### Potential compile errors

The method signature of `Iden::unquoted` is changed. If you're implementing `Iden` manually, you can modify it like below:
```rust
error[E0050]: method `unquoted` has 2 parameters but the declaration in trait `types::Iden::unquoted` has 1
  --> src/tests_cfg.rs:31:17
   |
   |     fn unquoted(&self, s: &mut dyn std::fmt::Write) {
   |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected 1 parameter, found 2
   |
  ::: src/types.rs:63:17
   |
   |     fn unquoted(&self) -> &str;
   |                 ----- trait requires 1 parameter
```
```rust
impl Iden for Glyph {
  - fn unquoted(&self, s: &mut dyn fmt::Write) {
  + fn unquoted(&self) -> &str {
  -     write!(
  -         s,
  -         "{}",
            match self {
                Self::Table => "glyph",
                Self::Id => "id",
                Self::Tokens => "tokens",
            }
  -     )
  -     .unwrap();
    }
}
```

### `Alias::new` is no longer needed

[#882](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/882)
SeaQuery encourages you to define all column / table identifiers in one place and use them throughout the project. But there are places where an alias is needed once off. Now `&'static str` is an `Iden`, so it can be used in all places where `Alias` are needed. The `Alias` type remains for backwards compatibility, so existing code should still compile. This can reduce the verbosity of code, for example:

```rust
let query = Query::select()
    .from(Character::Table)
  - .expr_as(Func::count(Expr::col(Character::Id)), Alias::new("count"))
  + .expr_as(Func::count(Expr::col(Character::Id)), "count")
    .to_owned();
```

```rust
  - Alias::new(format!("r{i}")).into_iden()
  + format!("r{i}").into_iden()
```

### Unboxed `Value` variants

[#925](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/925)
Most `Value` variants are now unboxed (except `BigDecimal` and `Array`). Previously the size is 24 bytes, now it's 32.
```rust
assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<Value>(), 32);
```

If you were constructing / pattern matching `Value` variants manually, `Box::new` can now be removed and pattern matching is simpler.

It also improved performance because memory allocation and indirection is removed in most cases.

#### Potential compile errors

If you encounter the following error, simply remove the `Box`

```rust
error[E0308]: mismatched types
    |
 >  | Value::String(Some(Box::new(string_value.to_string()))));
    |               ---- ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `String`, found `Box<String>`
    |               |
    |               arguments to this enum variant are incorrect
```

### `non_exhaustive` AST node enums

[#891](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/891)
`#[non_exhaustive]` are added to all AST node enums. It allows us to add new features and extend the AST without breaking the API.

```rust
+ #[non_exhaustive]
enum Mode {
    Creation,
    Alter,
    TableAlter,
}
```

#### Potential compile errors

If you encounter the following error, please add a wildcard match `_ => {..}`

```rust
error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `&_` not covered
    |
    |     match table_ref {
    |           ^^^^^^^^^ pattern `&_` not covered
    |
note: `TableRef` defined here
    |
    | pub enum TableRef {
    | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    = note: the matched value is of type `&TableRef`
    = note: `TableRef` is marked as non-exhaustive, so a wildcard `_` is necessary to match exhaustively
help: ensure that all possible cases are being handled by adding a match arm with a wildcard pattern or an explicit pattern as shown
    |
    | TableRef::FunctionCall(_, tbl) => SeaRc::clone(tbl),
 -> | &_ => todo!(),
```

### Reworked `TableRef` and `ColumnRef`

[#927](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/927)
Previously, the `TableRef` variants are a product of all valid combinations of `Option<Database>`, `Option<Schema>`, `Table` and `Option<Alias>`. It is excessive and makes pattern matching difficult.

Now they're collapsed into one. It makes constructing and pattern-matching `TableRef` / `ColumnRef` much easier.

```rust
// the following variants are collapsed into one:
enum TableRef {
    Table(DynIden),
    SchemaTable(DynIden, DynIden),
    DatabaseSchemaTable(DynIden, DynIden, DynIden),
    TableAlias(DynIden, DynIden),
    SchemaTableAlias(DynIden, DynIden, DynIden),
    DatabaseSchemaTableAlias(DynIden, DynIden, DynIden, DynIden),
    ..
}
// now it's just:
enum TableRef {
    Table(TableName, Option<DynIden>), // optional Alias
    ..
}

pub struct DatabaseName(pub DynIden);
pub struct SchemaName(pub Option<DatabaseName>, pub DynIden);
/// A table name, potentially qualified as [database.][schema.]table
pub struct TableName(pub Option<SchemaName>, pub DynIden);
```

Similarly for `ColumnRef`:

```rust
// before
enum ColumnRef {
    Column(DynIden),
    TableColumn(DynIden, DynIden),
    SchemaTableColumn(DynIden, DynIden, DynIden),
    Asterisk,
    TableAsterisk(DynIden),
}
// now
enum ColumnRef {
    /// A column name, potentially qualified as [database.][schema.][table.]column
    Column(ColumnName),
    /// An `*` expression, potentially qualified as [database.][schema.][table.]*
    Asterisk(Option<TableName>),
}

pub struct ColumnName(pub Option<TableName>, pub DynIden);
```

#### Potential compile errors

`TableRef`

```rust
error[E0061]: this enum variant takes 2 arguments but 1 argument was supplied
   --> src/entity/relation.rs:526:15
    |
 >  |     from_tbl: TableRef::Table("foo".into_iden()),
    |               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-------------------
    |                              ||
    |                              |expected `TableName`, found `DynIden`
    |                              argument #2 of type `Option<DynIden>` is missing
```
It's recommended to use the `IntoTableRef` trait to convert types instead of constructing AST manually.
```rust
use sea_orm::sea_query::IntoTableRef;

from_tbl: "foo".into_table_ref(),
```

`ColumnRef`

```rust
error[E0277]: the trait bound `fn(std::option::Option<TableName>) -> sea_query::ColumnRef {sea_query::ColumnRef::Asterisk}: IntoColumnRef` is not satisfied
    --> src/executor/query.rs:1599:21
    |
 >  |             .column(ColumnRef::Asterisk)
    |              ------ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `sea_query::Iden` is not implemented for fn item `fn(std::option::Option<TableName>) -> sea_query::ColumnRef {sea_query::ColumnRef::Asterisk}`
    |              |
    |              required by a bound introduced by this call

error[E0308]: mismatched types
    --> src/executor/query.rs:1607:54
    |
 >  |                 SimpleExpr::Column(ColumnRef::Column("id".into_iden()))
    |                                    ----------------- ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `ColumnName`, found `DynIden`
    |                                    |
    |                                    arguments to this enum variant are incorrect
```
In the former case `Asterisk` has an additional inner `Option<TableName>`, you can simply put `None`.
```rust
.column(ColumnRef::Asterisk(None))
```
In the latter case, `&'static str` can now be used in most methods that accepts `ColumnRef`.
```rust
Expr::column("id")
```

## New Features

### Query Audit

[#908](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/908)
In order to support Role Based Access Control (RBAC) in SeaORM, a given SQL query has to be analyzed to determine what permissions are needed to act on which resources.

It supports all the query types: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` and CTE. This requires the `audit` feature flag.

```rust
let query = Query::select()
    .columns([Char::Character])
    .from(Char::Table)
    .left_join(
        Font::Table,
        Expr::col((Char::Table, Char::FontId)).equals((Font::Table, Font::Id)),
    )
    .inner_join(
        Glyph::Table,
        Expr::col((Char::Table, Char::Character)).equals((Glyph::Table, Glyph::Image)),
    )
    .take();

assert_eq!(
    query.to_string(PostgresQueryBuilder),
    r#"SELECT "character"
    FROM "character"
    LEFT JOIN "font" ON "character"."font_id" = "font"."id"
    INNER JOIN "glyph" ON "character"."character" = "glyph"."image""#
);

assert_eq!(
    query.audit()?.selected_tables(),
    [
        Char::Table.into_iden(),
        Font::Table.into_iden(),
        Glyph::Table.into_iden(),
    ]
);
```

### Ergonomic raw SQL

[#952](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/952)
This is already covered in a previous [blog post](https://www.sea-ql.org/blog/2025-08-15-sea-query-raw-sql/).
In case you've missed it, we've created a new `raw_query!` macro with neat features to make writing raw SQL queries more ergononmic.

```rust
let a = 1;
struct B { b: i32 }
let b = B { b: 2 };
let c = "A";
let d = vec![3, 4, 5];

let query = sea_query::raw_query!(
    PostgresQueryBuilder,
    r#"SELECT ("size_w" + {a}) * {b.b} FROM "glyph"
       WHERE "image" LIKE {c} AND "id" IN ({..d})"#
);

assert_eq!(
    query.sql,
    r#"SELECT ("size_w" + $1) * $2 FROM "glyph"
       WHERE "image" LIKE $3 AND "id" IN ($4, $5, $6)"#
);
assert_eq!(
    query.values,
    Values(vec![1.into(), 2.into(), "A".into(), 3.into(), 4.into(), 5.into()])
);
```

The snippet above demonstrated:

1. named parameter: `{a}` injected
2. nested parameter access: `{b.b}` inner access
3. array expansion: `{..d}` expanded into three parameters

## Breaking Changes

### Replaced `SERIAL` with `GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` (Postgres)

[#918](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/918)
`SERIAL` is deprecated in Postgres because identity column (`GENERATED AS IDENTITY`) is more modern and, for example, can avoid sequence number quirks.

```rust
let table = Table::create()
    .table(Char::Table)
    .col(ColumnDef::new(Char::Id).integer().not_null().auto_increment().primary_key())
    .to_owned();

assert_eq!(
    table.to_string(PostgresQueryBuilder),
    [
        r#"CREATE TABLE "character" ("#,
            r#""id" integer GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,"#,
        r#")"#,
    ].join(" ")
);
```

If you need to support legacy systems you can still do:

```rust
let table = Table::create()
    .table(Char::Table)
    .col(ColumnDef::new(Char::Id).custom("serial").not_null().primary_key())
    .to_owned();

assert_eq!(
    table.to_string(PostgresQueryBuilder),
    [
        r#"CREATE TABLE "character" ("#,
            r#""id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY"#,
        r#")"#,
    ].join(" ")
);
```

### Changed `IntoXXX` traits into `Into<XXX>`

Changed `IntoCondition` (etc) traits to be defined as `trait IntoCondition: Into<Condition>`.
A blanket impl is added.
Now `IntoCondition` and `Into<Condition>` are completely interchangable, but you can still use `.into_condition()` for readability.

```rust
// before
trait IntoCondition {
    fn into_condition(self) -> Condition;
}

// now
trait IntoCondition: Into<Condition> {
    fn into_condition(self) -> Condition {
        self.into()
    }
}

impl<T> IntoCondition for T where T: Into<Condition> {}
```

If you have manually implemented `Into*` traits, it may cause conflicts. You
should rewrite your impls as as `impl From<..> for TableRef`.

Full list of changed traits:

* `IntoColumnDef` [#975](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/975)
* `IntoColumnRef` [#959](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/959)
* `IntoCondition` [#939](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/939)
* `IntoIden` [#973](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/973)
* `IntoIndexColumn` [#976](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/976)
* `IntoLikeExpr` [#974](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/974)
* `IntoTableRef` [#958](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/958)
* `IntoTypeRef` [#969](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/969)
* `IntoValueTuple` [#960](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/960)

## Performance Improvements

We benchmarked the query-building process - and found out that the bulk of the overhead came from serializing queries into strings, not from the AST building. By optimizing the string handling part of the serialization process, we improved the query-building performance by up to 15%!

### Replaced `write!` with `write_str`

[#947](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/947)
This simple but not-so-obvious change by far contributed the biggest gain.

We won't go into the details here, as there are two tracking issues in rust-lang:

+ format_args! is slow [rust/#76490](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76490)
+ Tracking issue for improving std::fmt::Arguments and format_args!() [rust/#99012](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/99012)

```rust
// before
write!(
    sql,
    "CONSTRAINT {}{}{} ",
    self.quote().left(),
    name,
    self.quote().right()
);

// now
sql.write_str("CONSTRAINT ");
sql.write_char(self.quote().left());
sql.write_str(name);
sql.write_char(self.quote().right());
sql.write_str(" ");
```

### Refactored Writer to avoid string allocation

[#945](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/945)
Less strings is better!

```rust
// before: an intermediate string is allocated
let value: String = self.value_to_string(value);
write!(sql, "{value}");

// now: write to the buffer directly
self.write_value(sql, value);

fn write_value(&self, sql: &mut dyn Write, value: &Value);
```

### Refactored Tokenizer to avoid string allocation

[#952](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/pull/952) Note that the tokenizer is not part of the runtime query-building code path, but still worth mentioning.

```rust
// before
enum Token {
    Quoted(String),
    Unquoted(String),
    Space(String),
    Punctuation(String),
}

// now
enum Token<'a> {
    Quoted(&'a str),
    Unquoted(&'a str),
    Space(&'a str),
    Punctuation(&'a str),
}
```

## Release Plan

[SeaQuery 1.0](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100---pending) is currently an `rc` release, and we plan to finalize it soon - meaning no more major breaking changes. If you feel adventurous or want to use some of the latest features, you can upgrade today. Please let us know the problems you faced, this will help us and the community. If you have ideas / feedback please [join the discussion](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/discussions/795) on GitHub!

As SeaORM is based on top of SeaQuery, the breaking changes above would impact SeaORM users as well. We tried to minimize the impact to SeaORM users that use SeaQuery lightly and most migrations can be done mechanically.

After SeaQuery 1.0, it will be the most exciting release - SeaORM 2.0!

## Our New Team

SeaQuery 1.0 wouldn't have happened without two contributors who joined us recently - [Dmitrii Aleksandrov](https://github.com/Expurple) and [Huliiiiii](https://github.com/Huliiiiii). They've made huge contributions that helped define this release, and we're super grateful for the effort and care they've poured into the project.
