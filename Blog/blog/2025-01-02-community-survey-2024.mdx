import * as Chart from '../src/chart-2024.js';

695 members of the SeaQL community from 47 countries kindly contributed their thoughts on using SeaQL libraries, learning Rust and employing Rust in their day to day development lives. From these responses we hope to get an understanding of where the SeaQL and Rust community stands in 2024.

This is our first community survey, we will conduct the survey annually to keep track of how the community evolves over time.

## Share Your Thoughts

### Q. Anything else you want to say?

Didn't expect this section to turn into a testimonial, thank you for all the kind words :)

> Love your toolchain, it's awesome to work with!

> Wonderful library! To provide some additional feedback: I found myself missing documentation in certain parts of the API, leading to me having to guess what the method actually does for a given database backend (namely in relation to query builders).

> Schema/migration management would be really nice. I have used Django in the past and loved the automatic migration file generation.

> SeaORM is great - it just replaces existing asp.net entity framework projects at our company.
